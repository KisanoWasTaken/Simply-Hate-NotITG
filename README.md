## Supported Languages

- English is Fully Supported (it is the mother tounge of the entire dev team as of writing)

- Basic Support for French is a focus (might as well put my education to use)

- Support for Japanese is Not Currently under Development

## Supported Systems and Clients

Like I said, only NotITG will work with this. As such, this theme should support anything that can run NotITG (Windows x64, Wine).

## Planned Additions

- A pause screen

- A new coat of paint (UI redesign)
